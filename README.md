# AIDP Alpha-Ready GPU Image Inference Demo

This project is a minimal GPU compute demo designed for integration with the AIDP decentralized GPU compute network.

## What It Does
- Executes a GPU-intensive inference workload
- Demonstrates how compute jobs are abstracted for decentralized execution
- Prepares a clean interface for AIDP alpha integration

## GPU Usage
The project runs a GPU-based matrix multiplication workload using PyTorch.  
Once AIDP dApp access is available, this workload will be submitted to AIDP GPU nodes instead of local execution.

## Why AIDP
AIDP enables decentralized, low-cost, and verifiable GPU compute.  
This project aligns with AIDP’s mission by demonstrating GPU inference readiness.

## Status
AIDP dApp is currently in alpha.  
This project is built to be AIDP-compatible and ready for immediate integration once access is available.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py


## AIDP Marketplace Project Page (Alpha)

This project is built as an alpha-ready GPU compute demo for the AIDP decentralized GPU network.

At the time of submission, AIDP Marketplace project creation is not publicly accessible.
Once AIDP enables public project listings, this project will be listed on the AIDP Marketplace
with full GPU integration and usage details.
